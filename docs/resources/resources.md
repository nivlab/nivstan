# Resources

## General resources

- [Stan reference manual](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/): the Bible of the Stan modelling language. There is a 90% probability it has a solution to your problem (if only you could find where).
- [Stan forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/): the official Stan discourse. Active and friendly community with relatively fast response times.
- [Stan case studies](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies): many helpful and detailed demonstrations of Stan use cases. Be sure to look at the robust workflow examples for [PyStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/pystan_workflow.html), [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/rstan_workflow.html), and [cmdStanpy](https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable-0.9.65/getting_started.html).
- [Stan prior recommendations](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations): recommendations for priors from Stan team. Always being updated (for better or worse).
- [Stan example models](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models): a veritable treasure trove of prewritten Stan models across a wide array of statistical problems.
- [ShinyStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan): helpful visualization tools compatible with RStan.
- [ArviZ](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz): helpful visualization tools compatible with PyStan.
- [hBayesDM](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM): user-friendly R package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational cognitive models for many decision-making tasks.
- [An Introduction to Stan](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/stan_intro.html#1_prologue) by Michael Betancourt.


## Stan for cognitive science

- [Stan for cognitive science](https://cognitive-science-stan.github.io/): aims to centralize all types of work in cognitive science that use the software Stan. Has some useful tutorials and links to papers using Stan.


## Bayesian Inference and more foundational knowledge
- More of [Michael Betancourt's blog](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/): lots of useful posts from intro to probability theory, to modelling, and some others..
- [An Introduction To Bayesian Inference (II): Inference Of Parameters And Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDVE0M-xQlc): a recorded lecture by David MacKay.
- [Statistical-rethinking] (https://github.com/Booleans/statistical-rethinking/blob/master/Statistical%20Rethinking%202nd%20Edition.pdf): a Bayesian Statistics book with examples in Stan.
